WHOIS is a protocol used to query databases that store registered users or assignees of an Internet resource, such as a domain name, an IP address block, or an autonomous system. The information returned by a WHOIS query typically includes the contact details of the domain registrant, as well as administrative and technical contacts.

There are many websites that offer WHOIS lookup services, some of which include:

- whois.icann.org
- whois.domaintools.com
- who.is
- www.whois.com
- www.whois.net
To perform a WHOIS lookup on a website, simply visit one of these sites, enter the domain name in question, and click "search" or "lookup". Depending on the site, you may be presented with a summary of the registration information or a link to view the full WHOIS record.
