## Project Management
The project should be added to a GitHub repository, where all the development progress and source code will be stored.
A markdown file should be created in the repository to explain how to use the tool effectively and help new users get started with it.
The developer should also learn how to fork the project and send pull requests to the original repository. This feature is essential for contributing to open-source projects, and it helps acknowledge the developer's contributions as well.

1. what is git?

5. fork current repository and make pull request to add your project link to "hall of fame".
